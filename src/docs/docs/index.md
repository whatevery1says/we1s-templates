# Introduction

The WE1S Workspace is a containerized environment for importing, managing, and analyzing textual data using a variety of built-in analysis and visualization tools. It is designed to be well-documented and easy to use, but extendible, code-based environment. In the WE1S Workspace, users interact with their data inside a project created from a template. The latest version of the template can be downloaded from [its Github repo](https://github.com/whatevery1says/we1s-templates).

!!! info "Version Compatibility"
    This documentation is compatible with v{{ config.workspace_version }} of the WE1S Workspace and v{{ config.template_version }} of the WE1S <span class="no-gloss">project</span> template.

Projects are managed primarily through a <a href="https://jupyter.org/" target="_blank">Jupyter notebooks-based</a> environment. Jupyter notebooks are a web-based interface for running code inside your web browser. If you are unfamiliar with Jupyter notebooks or Python, please read the the [How Jupyter Notebooks Work](how-jupyter-notebooks-work/) and [Introduction to Python](introduction-to-python/) sections of this guide before moving on to [Creating a Project](creating-a-project/). These tutorials provide  basic introductions to how to use Jupyter notebooks and some basic Python terminology useful for navigating the WE1S Workspace.

This website is designed to get you up and running once you have installed the Workspace on your computer.

!!! important
    The search function on this site requires a server environment. If you copy the `getting_started` folder to a location outside the Workspace, you should still be able to read this site, but the search function will not work.
