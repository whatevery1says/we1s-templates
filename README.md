Repository for [WE1S Workspace](https://we1s.ucsb.edu/wp-content/uploads/S-2.pdf) templates and documentation.

This repository is organised as follows:

1. `dist`: The `.tar.gz` archives of the Workspace templates. Templates will normally be downloaded from the archive files in this folder.
2. `docs`: The built HTML for the [Getting Started website](https://whatevery1says.github.io/we1s-templates/).
3. `src`: The source files for both the Getting Started website (in the `docs` subfolder and the Workspace templates (in the `templates` subfolder). The documentation is generated with [Mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), using the content of `src/docs`. The built site is then transferred to the main `docs` folder for publication to GitHub pages.

To get started, install [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/ "Project Jupyter | Home"), open `new_project.ipynb` and run it. More documentation is available at the Getting Started website.
